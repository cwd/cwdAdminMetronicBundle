# cwdAdminMetronicBundle
A template bridge for your Admin Backend

To use this Bundle you need to buy the Metronic Admin Template. 
You can find it on http://themeforest.net/item/metronic-responsive-admin-dashboard-template/4021469?ref=rufinus 

After you have Downloaded the template copy the content of the theme folder in this public directory.
You should now have 3 folders:
 - assets
 - sass
 - templates
 
 Currently this Bundle only uses the Admin4 Templates, more will follow eventually.
 Or you can make them yourself, i would appreciate a merge request on
